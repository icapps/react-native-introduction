Beware: It does not make use of redux. If you would make this application for production you should include redux in your porject.

## How to get started
Type `yarn` and run `yarn start`. Then you should get your expo QR code to scan. 
If you have local emulators running you can run `yarn run ios` or `yarn run android`. 

*If you run the application for the first time and nothing is shown, please refresh your application. The endpoints are hosted on a free heroku which goes to sleep after a while.*
